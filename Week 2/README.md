# What we covered

- We talked more about some Kotlin features, including:
  - [null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html)
  - [primary constructors](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors)

- We talked about [intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters), specifically:
  - what intents do
  - the difference between *implicit* and *explicit* intents
  - a couple of the [most common implicit intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common)
  - how to use an explicit intent to navigate to another Activity

The ExampleApp folder contains an app similar to the one that we created. Take a look at MainActivity.kt to learn about one more important part of intents, called "extras".
