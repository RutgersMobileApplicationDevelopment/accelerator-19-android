# What we covered

- We took a brief tour of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)
- We walked through [building your first app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/)
- We introduced:
  - [the Activity lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)
  - [layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout)
  - [Logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat)

The ExampleApp folder contains the app that we created. I've added comments to MainActivity.kt that explain a lot of the code in that file (including a few places where I make use of Kotlin-specific features).
