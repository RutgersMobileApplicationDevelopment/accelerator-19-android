# What we covered

- We introduced [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)
  - why it's called "RecyclerView" and why it's you should use it instead of [ListView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView)
  - [RecyclerView.Adapter](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview#Adapter)
  - [RecyclerView.LayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview#modifying-layout)
- We also talked about how you can make use of [instance state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html#instance-state) to save and restore simple data that will persist when your Activity is destroyed

The Week4App folder contains the app we created, with some explanatory comments added.
