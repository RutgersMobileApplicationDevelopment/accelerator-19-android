# What we covered

- We introduced [fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments), specifically:
  - what they are, and how they're different from activities
  - the fragment lifecycle (it's similar to the activity lifecycle)
  - performing fragment transactions
  - how you can communicate between a fragment and its parent activity

The Week3App folder contains the app we created, with some explanatory comments added.
